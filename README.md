# LWC-Simple-Account-Search
Creates a Lightning Web Component that allows the user to search for accounts by letter, and displays the accounts by ID, Name, and Type.

Added an Edit button that brings up a modal with a form, allowing the user to edit the account information from there.

NOT WORKING:
Attempting to wire information to the form, works when recordId is hardcoded, I am currently attempting to make it dynamic.
